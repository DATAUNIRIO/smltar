Indexes giving keywords in their context are proposed as suitable for disseminating new information. These can be entirely machine-generated and hence kept up-to-date with the current literature. A compatible coding scheme to identify the indexed documents is also proposed. In it elements are automatically extracted from the usual identifiers of the document so that the coded identifier yields a maximum of information while remaining susceptible to normal methods of ordering.},

Users may apply them without awareness of their surprising omissions (e.g. {``}hasn{'}t{''} but not {``}hadn{'}t{''}) and inclusions ({``}computer{''}), or their incompatibility with a particular tokenizer. Motivated by issues raised about the Scikit-learn stop list, we investigate variation among and consistency within 52 popular English-language stop lists, and propose strategies for mitigating these issues.",
