Indexes giving keywords in their context are proposed as suitable for disseminating new information. These can be entirely machine-generated and hence kept up-to-date with the current literature. A compatible coding scheme to identify the indexed documents is also proposed. In it elements are automatically extracted from the usual identifiers of the document so that the coded identifier yields a maximum of information while remaining susceptible to normal methods of ordering.},
