# What are words?

Medium-small in length.

Talk about language.

Give examples of how text is governed by patterns and examples of how languages can be messy.

Emphisize how different languages have different features.

"Different languages" also means: Dialects, slag, medium (tweet vs legal document).

Langauge changes over time.

While we would like to think that we are able to extract the latent space purely from the text, it isn't possible.

Use classic examples of word play and word ambiguity
