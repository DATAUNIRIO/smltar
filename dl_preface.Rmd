# (PART) Deep Learning Methods {-}

# Foreword {-}

In this last section of the book we will follow the same style as the previous section as we are still trying to create accurate predictions, 
but we are switching our attention to deep neural networks.

This section will focus on bag-of-words and word embeddings using CNN, RNN and LSTMs.

TODO: Algorithmic bias specific to deep learning or similar

For the following chapters, we will use tensorflow with keras framework to do preprocessing, modeling and evaluation.

TODO: add pro and cons table for differences between deep learning and non-deep learning
