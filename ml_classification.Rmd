# Classification

What is classification.

## First attempt

first attempt and full game will use same data. 
First attempt might use a subset of the data to make the example easier to understand.
and properly to give balanced dataset, which then later can be explored.

### Look at the data

### Modeling

### Evaluation

## Different types of models

(Not all of these models are good, but are used to show strenghs and weaknessed)
- SVM
- Naive Bayes
- glmnet
- Random forrest
- knn
- NULL model

## Two class or multiclass

## Case study: relationship between performace

## Case Study: feature hashing

## What evaluation metrics are appropiate

Data will most likely be sparse when using BoW

## Full game

### Feature selection

### Splitting the data

### Specifying models

### Cross-validation

### Evaluation

Inteprebility.

"Can we get comparable performance with a simpler model?"
Compare with simple rule based model
